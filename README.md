# The Trust Dilemma

Jiin Jung (at Claremont Graduate University) and I develop this Agent-based model for what we call the *Trust Dilemma* in the 2017 Workshop in Computational Social Science at the Santa Fe Institute.

The repository contains `python` code for the Agent-based model and some `R` code for the data analysis. The file `run.py` creates some datasets for different levels of trust thresholds among agents. Keep in mind that this model is extremely simple and makes a bunch of unreal assumptions.
