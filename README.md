# The Trust Dilemma

<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiin_Jung3" target="blank">Jiin Jung</a> and I develop this Agent-based model for what we call the *Trust Dilemma* in the 2017 Workshop in Computational Social Science at the Santa Fe Institute.

The repository contains `python` code for the Agent-based model and some `R` code for the data analysis. The file `run.py` creates some datasets for different levels of trust thresholds among agents. Consider that this code is not very efficient and it may take several hours to run, depending on the sample size of agents and the number of iterations.
